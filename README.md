## description and usage:
1."PINN-ODE... .py" gives the network and figures of example 1 in section 3.1.
2."PINN-PDE with proportional delay.py" and "Load_Models_pde_proportional_delay.py" are codes for example 2 in section3.2 .
3."PINN-PDE with subtraction delay.py" and "Load_Models_pde_subtraction_delay.py" are used in section3.3 for example3,
  "series solution.csv"  gives the value of "truncated series solution" in grid points by  mathematica 12.0, this file will
  will be used while comparing with PINN method in related "Load_Model" code.
  
Readers should run  the PINN source code first and the "Load..." file later in each example.
